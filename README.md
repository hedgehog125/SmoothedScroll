## ‚ùì FAQ

### How does **Smoothed Scroll** work?

**Smoothed Scroll** works by intercepting the scroll events in Windows applications and applying a smoothing algorithm to them. This allows for a more fluid scrolling experience compared to the default behavior. The program runs in the background and can be configured to adjust the scrolling speed and behavior according to user preferences.

### Why do antivirus programs block **Smoothed Scroll**?

Antivirus software may flag **Smoothed Scroll** as a potential threat due to its use of **Nuitka** for building the executable. Nuitka compiles Python code into standalone executables, which can sometimes resemble the behavior of malicious software. This is a common occurrence with many legitimate applications that use similar techniques. If you encounter such a warning, you can usually add an exception in your antivirus settings to allow **Smoothed Scroll** to run.
